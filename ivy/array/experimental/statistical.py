        Parameters
        ----------
        self
            Input array.
        axis
            Axis or axes along which the medians are computed. The default is to compute
            the median along a flattened version of the array.
        keepdims
            If this is set to True, the axes which are reduced are left in the result
            as dimensions with size one.
        out
            optional output array, for writing the result to.

        Returns
        -------
        ret
            The median of the array elements.

        Examples
        --------
        >>> a = ivy.array([[10, 7, 4], [3, 2, 1]])
        >>> a.median()
        3.5
        >>> a.median(axis=0)

        Parameters
        ----------
        self

        axis
            Axis or axes along which the means are computed.

        keepdims
            If this is set to True, the axes which are reduced are left in the result
            as dimensions with size one. With this option, the result will broadcast
            correctly against the original a. If the value is anything but the default,

            sub-classes of ndarray. If the sub-classes methods does not implement 
            keepdims any exceptions will be raised.
        dtype
            The desired data type of returned tensor. Default is None.

            optional output array, for writing the result to.

        Returns
        -------
