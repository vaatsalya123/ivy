        Parameters
        ----------
        self
            input array. Should have a numeric data type.
        axis
            axis along which to search. If None, the function must return the index of
            the maximum value of the flattened array. Default  None.
        keepdims
            If this is set to True, the axes which are reduced are left in the result as
            dimensions with size one. With this option, the result will broadcast
            correctly against the array.
        out
            If provided, the result will be inserted into this array. It should be of
            the appropriate shape and dtype.

        Returns
        -------
        ret
            if axis is None, a zero-dimensional array containing the index of the first
            occurrence of the maximum value; otherwise, a non-zero-dimensional array
            containing the indices of the maximum values. The returned array must have
            the default array index data type.

        Parameters
        ----------
        self

        axis
            axis along which to search. If None, the function must return the index of
            the minimum value of the flattened array. Default = None.
        keepdims
            if True, the reduced axes (dimensions) must be included in the result as
            singleton dimensions, and, accordingly, the result must be compatible with
            the input array (see Broadcasting). Otherwise, if False, the reduced axes

        Returns
        -------
