builder
    A class (inheriting from :class:`~sphinx.builders.Builder`) that takes
      parsed documents and performs an action on them.  Normally, builders
      translate the documents to an output format, but it is also possible to
      use the builder builders that e.g. check for broken links in the
      documentation, or build coverage information.
    
alpha
    The alpha version of Sphinx.
